# ENGO551_LAB2_Zian
Hi my name is Zian and this is my first geoweb app.

So all the code in this app is located in a single html file. To start things off, we have our main page where we are greeted with a map of calgary. 

Next we have a search widgit and we can search for a particular range of dates. Then by hitting find permits, we see them pop up on various parts of the map. 

You can also notice that when there are multiple permits in a nearby area, they are grouped and the number of permits is displayed. If you click on one, it zooms into the area and the grouped permits split up.

Then when you click on a single point, a pop up notification lets you know the things you need to know

If you want to clear the map, simply hit the refresh map button and the map will be cleared and reset to the initial zoom level.

I was able to find a github repository that did something similar, so I used that for reference. Here is a link to it: https://github.com/samrknight12/project2
